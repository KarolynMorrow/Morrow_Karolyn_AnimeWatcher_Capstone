# Morrow_Karolyn_AnimeWatcher_Capstone

🌟 Project Overview. 


AnimeWatcher is a free and easily accessible web platform designed to broaden the horizons of both seasoned and new anime enthusiasts. In an era where anime is rapidly gaining mainstream popularity, many newcomers are primarily exposed to recent titles. AnimeWatcher aims to bridge this gap by offering a vast library of both classic and contemporary anime, allowing users to discover, explore, and review shows across various genres, all while providing clear guidance on where to watch them.

Our mission is to make the diverse world of anime approachable for everyone, fostering a community where appreciation for new blockbusters and timeless classics can coexist and flourish.

✨ Features (Current and Future)  


Currently, AnimeWatcher offers the following key functionalities:

Dynamic Welcome Page: A captivating landing page that highlights a currently trending popular anime and showcases a curated selection of popular beginner-friendly titles to help new users dive in.

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in pages are implemented, laying the groundwork for personalized features and community interactions in future updates.

Comprehensive Anime Details: Leveraging data from the Kitsu API, AnimeWatcher provides rich information for each anime title, including:

Visuals: High-quality anime photos.

Core Information: Title, detailed synopsis, and release/end dates.

Watch Links: Direct links to platforms where the anime can be streamed.

Episode Count: Clear indication of the number of episodes.
